This is a simple program where the user can click on squares and they will change colors. This grid can then be reset.
For a live preview click the link in the 'About' section.

Potential future improvements:
 - add ability for user to customize the grid size.
 - add ability for user to customize which color they would like to use for their 'brush'
 - beautify the page.
